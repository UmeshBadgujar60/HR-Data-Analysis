# HR-Data-Analysis
I began by importing four CSV files into Power Query in Power BI. 
Next, I consolidated multiple tables using the "Append Queries" feature to ensure data integration. 
I then refined the dataset by modifying the data types for each column using the "Change Data Type" option.

To enhance data consistency, I utilized the "Replace Values" option to capitalize each word in the Employee Name column and applied the "Remove Duplicates" option to eliminate redundant records. 
Additionally, I created a conditional column using the "Add Conditional Column" feature to classify employees based on the Salary column into categories such as Fresher, Junior, and Senior.

Finally, I established relationships between datasets by merging two tables using the "Merge Queries" feature, ensuring seamless data connectivity and analysis.
